You must have Java Runtime Environment installed on the maching in order to run the game through "runGame.jar"
The executables must also be kept in their original path in order to work.

There is also a windows .exe executable. In order to run it, you must start it from the windows command line. It is also untested for compatibility issues, therefore I recommed using "runGame.jar"
